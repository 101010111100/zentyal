# Class: EBox::Samba::Security::SID
#
#   A security identifier (SID) uniquely identifies a security principal.
#   Each security principal has a unique SID that is issued by a security
#   agent. The agent can be a Microsoft WindowsÂ® local system or domain.
#   The agent generates the SID when the security principal is created.
#   The SID can be represented as a character string or as a structure.
#   When represented as strings, for example in documentation or logs,
#   SIDs are expressed as follows:
#   S-1-IdentifierAuthority-SubAuthority1-SubAuthority2-...-SubAuthorityn
#   The top-level issuer is the authority. Each issuer specifies, in an
#   implementation-specific manner, how many integers identify the next issuer.
#   A newly created account store is assigned a 96-bit identifier (a
#   cryptographic strength (pseudo) random number).
#   A newly created security principal in an account store is assigned a
#   32-bit identifier that is unique within the store.
#   The last item in the series of SubAuthority values is known as the
#   relative identifier (RID).
#   Differences in the RID are what distinguish the different SIDs generated
#   within a domain.
